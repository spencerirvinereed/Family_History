Roughly 1/2 the size of Singapore\n\nTo make a living, she would travel to 목포시, roughly 15 miles to the north, purchase items that she would sell in an open-air market.\n\nHowever, after seeing the local women working side by side with men, and not wanting that for her daughters, she moved and joined her relatives in 인천.\n\n![Seated, Mom, her sisters, from left to right, 현신, 현덕, 현애](m5.JPG)\n\nMy earliest memory is that she owned a 슈퍼마켓, in the 동인천 area.\n\nShe would always treated me kindly and she seemed angelic to me.\n\nHowever, through her smiles, I could tell she always carried a tinge of sadness.\n\nBy the time I was born, she had been a widow for nearly 25 years and she endured abrupt change in fortune and had escaped to South with just the family.\n\nHer faith in Christ carried her through.\n\nShe seemed frail but she was a strong person.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI remember we were getting ready to leave for 김포공항.\n\nShe came and didn't say much, and we sensed her sadness.\n\nI recall, she had brought some apples for our journey to America.\n\n![](m2.jpeg)\n\nMy mom's sisters took turn in taking care of Grandma Kim.\n\nMet her again in 1990, because my aunt 현덕 had taken good care of her, she looked young and healthy, even as she approached 80s.\n\nShe looked more vibrant and seemed at peace.\n\n![](m1.JPG)\n\nWhen she passed away on November 1999, all of the children had gathered by her side.\n\nShe had asked for some 감 or persimmons, her favorite\n\nThe store had closed by then, told her that we would get her some in the morning.\n\nShe did not make it to morning.\n\nAt one time she was among the happiest and most blessed women, according to my mom\n\nMost, if not all, of her material, worldly possession was taken and also her husband.\n\nShe would live nearly 60 years alone.\n\nBut she raised 4 daughters and a son to adulthood, married them to fellow North Koreans.\n\nPlanted in them a faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nShe taught us by example, for she lived an angel-like life and we have a strong faith that she is united with her husband and the rest of the family.\n\n![](m3.jpeg)\n\n## My Father and My Mother Family Diagram\n\nA copy of abbreviated family record, [link](https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/Family_History/posts/20240218%20Hwang%20Family%20Intro/)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"grViz html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-71385b727c24498e3eab\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-71385b727c24498e3eab\">{\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"digraph {\\n\\ngraph [layout = dot, rankdir = TD]\\n\\n# define the global styles of the nodes.
