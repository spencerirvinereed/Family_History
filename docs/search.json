    "text": "Grandma Kim (the wife of 황운학), was the envy of her neighbors.\nShe was that bride from a big city to the north, 평양 (平壤)1\nMarried to a well to do merchant.\nShe would wear the latest fashion, 양장2 (洋裝 or西服) instead of the traditional 한복 most women wore.\nGrandpa and Grandma were landowners and business minded persons.\nThey owned orchards, Grandpa would venture out to big cities to acquire new items\nFor they operated 협성 상회 (協成商会), a local sundry shop as well as a branch of 매일신문 (毎日新聞)\nThey welcomed their 8th child and only surviving son into the family.\nHe was to fill the void left by the death of their 3rd child, also a son.\n(Their 3rd and 4th child only lived a month. a son (득원) and a daughter (현숙) Both developed respiratory illness after catching what seemed to be common cold)\nThen quickly life got difficult for her and the family.\nHer husband, developed acute appendicitis and passed away.\nOne hundred days after the birth of their son, at age 33.3\nShe went from a landowner to serf within 3 to 4 years as communism replaced freedom and free market.\nShe escaped North Korea, with the help from her relatives. Link to details of the escape\nShe settled in the island of 진도.4\nTo make a living, she would travel to 목포시, roughly 15 miles to the north, purchase items that she would sell in an open-air market.\nHowever, after seeing the local women working side by side with men, and not wanting that for her daughters, she moved and joined her relatives in 인천.\nMy earliest memory is that she owned a 슈퍼마켓, in the 동인천 area.\nShe would always treated me kindly and she seemed angelic to me.\nHowever, through her smiles, I could tell she always carried a tinge of sadness.\nBy the time I was born, she had been a widow for nearly 25 years and she endured abrupt change in fortune and had escaped to South with just the family.\nHer faith in Christ carried her through.\nShe seemed frail but she was a strong person.\nI remember we were getting ready to leave for 김포공항.\nShe came and didn’t say much, and we sensed her sadness.\nI recall, she had brought some apples for our journey to America.\nMy mom’s sisters took turn in taking care of Grandma Kim.\nMet her again in 1990, because my aunt 현덕 had taken good care of her, she looked young and healthy, even as she approached 80s.\nShe looked more vibrant and seemed at peace.\nWhen she passed away on November 1999, all of the children had gathered by her side.\nShe had asked for some 감 or persimmons, her favorite\nThe store had closed by then, told her that we would get her some in the morning.\nShe did not make it to morning.\nAt one time she was among the happiest and most blessed women, according to my mom\nMost, if not all, of her material, worldly possession was taken and also her husband.\nShe would live nearly 60 years alone.\nBut she raised 4 daughters and a son to adulthood, married them to fellow North Koreans.\nPlanted in them a faith in Jesus Christ.\nShe taught us by example, for she lived an angel-like life and we have a strong faith that she is united with her husband and the rest of the family."

    "text": "우리는..가끔\n부모님 생각을 합니다\n부모님은…가끔\n우리생각을 쉬실 때가있습니다\n\n\nTurn of the century was a time of confluence in Korea.\nThe old music, once available in records or vinyls were repackaged and available in digital audio format (Compact Disks).\n\n\n\n(L) 연가 戀歌, (R)추억 記憶\n\n\nA boxed set of popular music was available in all places. For a price of 2 movie tickets one could own nearly 50 years of music history in 6 CDs.\n113 songs in all.\nRecently discovered these 2 boxed set and its packaging One box, containing Memories 추억, had this message imprinted.\n\nWe… sometimes think of our parents. Sometimes, our parents… take a break from thinking of us.\n\n\nMy parents and I often listened to these songs together. My parents knew songs from the first 2 CDs by heart. For they had experienced the stories mentioned in these songs\nThe songs my parents listened in their 20s and 30s.\nAs I listened with them, I could imagine their struggles and understood why these songs were meaningful.\nA combination of words and music that covered what should have been their life’s high moments that became its most disappointing and discouraging moments.\nYet somehow, these songs had a hint of hopeful messages, my parents’ life overcame those challenges and established a family.\n\nNow my parents are no longer with us. They have finished their mission in this life.\nWonder how often they take break from thinking of us and watching over us.\nEach time I think of them, my appreciation and love for them deepens.\n\nA spring storm came, the setting sun cast its light towards the mountains and clouds.\nThe confluence of light and clouds, refractions and reflections created rainbows against the Cascade mountain.\nThat rainbow reminded me our lives is a miracle.\nA fleeting, physical reminder from our parents. A collective message of love and appreciation from the children.\nThank you for teaching and living your lives so that we can traverse this life with a sure knowledge.\n\nAnd this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent"

She was a faithful Christian till the end. Passed away on 26 April of 2017 Her 2 sons attended her memorial service.\nWhen she passed away in Maryland, I didn’t have much information.\nI began calling Korean churches, near her home.\nAt one of the churches a lady answered. She didn’t know my 고모님.\nBut her mother, who was listening, she knew our 고모님 through the Senior Citizen Center they both attended.\nShe told us where her church was. 세계장로 교회 of Gaithersburg, Maryland. I got to attend the church on Sunday and meet and thank her fellow church members.\nThe helpful lady’s church was nearby and I was able to see her and thank her in person.\nI am grateful for the times and memories and the example of faith of 고모님."

In the context of today’s technology-savvy teenagers, a filmstrip might be described as follows: Imagine a visual story told through a series of rectangular images, like the frames on Instagram stories, but in a linear format. Each frame depicts a scene or moment from the story, accompanied by text or captions to convey dialogue, narration, or additional context. The images are vibrant and dynamic, resembling the high-definition visuals found in movies and TV shows, but condensed into smaller, easily digestible segments.

Sister K said she will take care of it, thinking of me.\nFollowed the saying,\n&gt;Never delegate understanding1\nThe tire was indeed flat, beyond the air level needed for driving.\nThe Plan,\nChange out the tire, drive to the nearest tire shop.\nReasons for my hesitation was realized, plus some unanticipated.\nThe pneumatic tools used at the shop can tighten bolts far stronger than these less than full length wrench tools.\nAfter struggling and figuring out the “throw the weight” approach to loosening the bolt, finally removed 5 requisite bolts, then raised the van sufficiently to remove the tire.\nThen came the next hurdle.\nCouldn’t lift the bench seats to access the spare tire. Two of us struggled for good 10 minutes, and almost gave up.\nCalled our son.\nWhen someone chimed,\nJohn did it in a minute what took me a while. He pulled on both pulleys at the same time.\nThen came the unexpected. Newer vehicles don’t carry spares, to maximize both passenger and cargo space.\nNow I had wished I had brought the portable tire inflator. Was too set on changing to the spare tire and driving to the tire center\nThen my son pointed out that there was indeed tire inflator in the car we drove. Not sure how it got there.\nLearned again not to assume something was present. Check or verify first.\nThe other, perhaps more important lesson was the one given by John. He took time and helped. There were others that passed but didn’t stop.\nIn my younger days, I would have taken time to determine who’s at fault or where to place the blame.\nThat would be the earthly or telestial thing to do.\nThat 1980s poet/singer Howard wrote some decades ago\nIt is a difficult lesson to learn. When we try to explain events of our lives with our limited understanding.\nBut struggle we must, until we realize that sometimes there are no earthly reasons that will explain what has happened.\nWe must turn to other sources for the inspiration and comfort.\nThought of these verses from the Gospel according to John.2\n1 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.\n2 And his disciples asked him, saying,\n3 Jesus answered,\nOr that,"

A visiting authority, Young Men General Presidency member was speaking in Korea.\nA young man was assigned to interpret for him.\n\nHe handled the assignment with skill and understanding beyond his years.\nThe speaker commented on the singing with “Wow!” And asked the young man to translate it into Korean. The interpreter said “와우으으” (the Korean prounciation of Wow)\nObviously young man was aware and comfortable in both languages and culture.\nAt times he guided the translation to better suit the audience of young Korean members.\nObserving the cardinal rule of interpretation.\n\nUnderstanding by the audience over the exactness or technical excellence.\n\nThe latest ChatGPT would have made technically sound translation.\nI am confident that the audience on that Sunday evening spiritually benefited from the talents of the interpreter.\n\nA part of the 4-year assignment to Korea was to translate for visiting headquarter executives.\nI could understand English fairly well, having lived in US for 25 years.\nI chose words that I knew and formed expressions that captured the essence of the visitor’s message.\nNumbers in Korea are measured in units of 10,000 or 만(萬)\nWhen US based spoke in terms of thousands of dollars, had to make some quick calculations along with remembering prevailing currency exchange rate (1 USD = 1,400 KRW, the rate at that time)\nAnother mental hurdle was remembering several units for measuring an area.\nMetric unit is square meters, meter\\(^{2}\\).\nHowever, Koreans use the unit of 평(坪, pyong) when measuring a building or apartment spaces.\n평 is about 3.3 square meters. Or a 6 ft by 6 ft space, or 36 square feet.\nDepending on who was descrbing the space, one had to have those conversion factors memorized.\nAfter a while, however, I no longer relied on the conversion factors.\nAs most missionaries and expats have experienced, I became familiar with the local currency and value of things.\nI would walk into an apartment and think in terms of 평 Recognizing that most popular apartment sizes were in the 30+평 (~1200 feet\\(^{2}\\), 115 meter\\(^{2}\\)) neighborhood.\nLife got easier as adjusted to Korean ways of measuring, reckoning and living.\n\nIn this life, we make sense of things by assigning values and by learning the interpretation of the locals.\nMoreover, there are numerous guides and approach on how to adjust to a new place, written by visitors and locals alike.\nHowever, we all share the memories and reminders of the same place of origin.\nThe home that we came from and the same eternal home that we all will return to someday.\nHow or whether we incorporate elements from that home in this life is matter of choice and tradition.\nLook forward to a time when no interpretation is necessary, due to advancements in technology and by embracing traditions that bring us together.\nFor we all have felt that order and harmony – at times in our lives.\n\nTraditions of our fathers and mothers will be updated and some jettisoned.\n\n…till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;\n\n\nEphesians 4:13\n\n\nFor the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.\n\n\nHabakkuk 2:14"

    "text": "Risk Priority Number: Courtesy of GPT\nRPN, or Risk Priority Number, is a numerical value used in Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to prioritize potential failure modes based on their severity, occurrence likelihood, and detectability. Here’s how RPN is determined:\n\nSeverity (S): Severity refers to the potential impact or consequences of a failure mode on the system, process, or product being analyzed. It’s typically assessed on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 representing negligible impact and 10 representing catastrophic impact. The severity rating reflects the seriousness of the consequences if the failure were to occur.\nOccurrence (O): Occurrence evaluates the likelihood or frequency of a failure mode occurring within the given system, process, or product. It’s also rated on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 indicating rare occurrence and 10 indicating almost certain occurrence. The occurrence rating reflects the probability of the failure happening.\nDetection (D): Detection assesses the likelihood of detecting the failure mode before it leads to negative consequences. Like severity and occurrence, it’s rated on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 indicating very high detectability and 10 indicating very low detectability. The detection rating reflects the effectiveness of current detection methods or controls in place.\n\nTo determine the Risk Priority Number (RPN) for a specific failure mode, you simply multiply the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings together:\n\\[ RPN = Severity×Occurrence×Detection \\]\nThe resulting RPN provides a single numerical value that represents the relative risk associated with that particular failure mode. Higher RPN values indicate higher priority for addressing that failure mode because they represent combinations of more severe consequences, higher likelihood of occurrence, and lower detectability.\nRPNs help prioritize resources and efforts toward mitigating or eliminating the most critical failure modes to improve the overall reliability, safety, and quality of the system, process, or product being analyzed."

    "text": "FMEA Steps: Courtesy of GPT\nFMEA, or Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, is a systematic approach used to identify and prioritize potential failure modes within a process, product, or system, and to understand the potential effects of those failures. Here’s a breakdown of the process:\n\nScope Definition: Identify the process, product, or system to be analyzed. Define the boundaries and objectives of the analysis.\nTeam Formation: Assemble a cross-functional team with members who have diverse expertise related to the process or product being analyzed. This team typically includes engineers, designers, quality experts, and relevant stakeholders.\nIdentification of Failure Modes: Brainstorm and list all possible failure modes that could occur within the chosen process or system. A failure mode is any way in which a process or product could fail to meet its intended purpose or function.\nDetermination of Effects: For each identified failure mode, determine the potential effects or consequences of that failure. These effects can range from minor inconveniences to serious safety hazards or financial losses.\nAssignment of Severity Ratings: Assign a severity rating to each failure mode based on the potential consequences. Severity ratings typically range from 1 to 10, with higher numbers indicating more severe consequences.\nIdentification of Causes: Determine the root causes or mechanisms behind each failure mode. This involves analyzing the factors that could lead to the occurrence of the failure.\nAssignment of Occurrence Ratings: Estimate the likelihood or frequency of each failure mode occurring. Occurrence ratings are typically assigned on a scale from 1 to 10, with higher numbers indicating a higher likelihood of occurrence.\nAssignment of Detection Ratings: Assess the likelihood of detecting each failure mode before it leads to a negative consequence. Detection ratings are also typically assigned on a scale from 1 to 10, with higher numbers indicating a higher likelihood of detection.\nCalculation of Risk Priority Numbers (RPN): Calculate the Risk Priority Number for each failure mode by multiplying the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings together (RPN = Severity × Occurrence × Detection).\nPrioritization and Action Planning: Prioritize the identified failure modes based on their RPNs. Focus on addressing the failure modes with the highest RPNs first. Develop action plans to mitigate or eliminate these high-priority failure modes, which may involve design changes, process improvements, or additional quality controls.\nImplementation of Corrective Actions: Implement the action plans developed to address the high-priority failure modes. Monitor the effectiveness of these actions and make adjustments as necessary.\nContinuous Improvement: FMEA is an iterative process. Regularly review and update the analysis as new information becomes available or as changes are made to the process or product. This helps to ensure ongoing quality improvement and risk management."
