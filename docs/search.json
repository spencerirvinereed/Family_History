    "text": "Grandma Kim (김옥돌, 金玉乭) was born in the early 1900s, when Korea was transitioning from Kings to a period of occupation.\nShe was born a year after the last 조선 Dynasty King, 순종 (純宗), was forced abdicate.\nAt the urging of her older brother, 김동훈, the family moved from 함경도 to 서울, before the start of the Korean War.1\nGrandma and Grandpa were able to establish a home near 서울.\nHowever, when the war started, my father was called into the South Korean Army.\nAnd the family retreated further south.\nDuring this upheaval and confusion, my grandfather and my father’s older brother were lost and never heard from again.\nSubsequently, my grandmother either lived alone or with my family or with her youngest son and his wife, for the balance of her life.\nAlthough Grandma adjusted to the city living, she loved country side and she was a farmer at heart.\nWe used to have a black and white photo of her wearing a hat and carrying basket and sickle to harvest her crops.\nFor her, no greater joy than cultivating crop and raising farm animals.\nThere was a gathering on August 1990 to celebrate her 80th Birthday. A Family Gathering\nWe got see her extended family, for the first time in nearly 2 decades.\nShe spent time with our family after she turned 90.\nBehind our urban apartment, there was a path that led to a hill and the hiking trail with moderate incline.\nGrandma could out-climb most young people, even in her 90s.\nShe was a devout Christian.\nFrom the time I had left Korea and returned with a family of my own, I hadn’t seen her in nearly 25 years.\nDuring those years her faith in Christ had increased, Christ was the center of her life.\nShe shared life’s lessons with her grandchildren. Also her great grandchildren,\nGrandma passed away, a year after we left Korea. She was nearly 93 years old.\nIt is a common practice to cremate now days in Korea.\nHowever, she was buried in a plot that is owned by my dad’s youngest brother’s in-laws.\nThe in-laws were also from North Korea, and for a time took care of our Grandma near their home in 평택\nI am grateful for her dedication as a faithful Christian.\nShe was a devoted grandmother to us.\nThe best one can hope for."

    "text": "I have a number of 이모님들.\nMy mom had 4 younger sisters.\nMy Dad had 3 younger brothers.\nHe had only one sister.\n고모님, 강금녀.\nGrowing up she lived close to us.\nBecause 고모님 got married earlier than my dad, her sons 복남, 복용 were a few years older than my sisters.\nHer husband, also from Northern Korea, was the only one to escape to the South.\nConsequently, we did many things as an extended family.\nOne time, three of us, my younger cousin, 인영, my sister and I were visiting 고모님댁\nWe tried to cross the railroad tracks while the train was approaching.\nMy sister was quick and she escaped angry train engineers.\n인영 and I were captured and the train engineers called my mother and gave a stern lecture about taking care her children.1\nGrowing up, I often saw 고모님 and 할머님 together.\nNot only did they look similar but they also lived close to one another and they did many things together.\n고모님 attended all of the Kangs gatherings and functions.\nWhen dad went to Vietnam, during the 60s, she went to the 김포 Airport.\nWhen our family left for the United States, she came and supported us.\nWhen we returned to Korea during the 90s, she was there to greet us.\n고모님 moved to the United States in her later years. She was a faithful Christian till the end. Passed away on 26 April of 2017 Her 2 sons attended her memorial service.\nWhen she passed away in Maryland, I didn’t have much information.\nI began calling Korean churches, near her home.\nAt one of the churches a lady answered. She didn’t know my 고모님.\nBut her mother, who was listening, she knew our 고모님 through the Senior Citizen Center they both attended.\nShe told us where her church was. 세계장로 교회 of Gaithersburg, Maryland. I got to attend the church on Sunday and meet and thank her fellow church members.\nThe helpful lady’s church was nearby and I was able to see her and thank her in person.\nI am grateful for the times and memories and the example of faith of 고모님."
