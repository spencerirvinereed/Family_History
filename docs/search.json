    "text": "Grandma Kim (김옥돌, 金玉乭) was born in the early 1900s, when Korea was transitioning from Kings to a period of occupation.\nShe was born a year after the last 조선 Dynasty King, 순종 (純宗), was forced abdicate.\nAt the urging of her older brother, 김동훈, the family moved from 함경도 to 서울, before the start of the Korean War.1\nGrandma and Grandpa were able to establish a home near 서울.\nHowever, when the war started, my father was called into the South Korean Army.\nAnd the family retreated further south.\nDuring this upheaval and confusion, my grandfather and my father’s older brother were lost and never heard from again.\nSubsequently, my grandmother either lived alone or with my family or with her youngest son and his wife, for the balance of her life.\nAlthough Grandma adjusted to the city living, she loved country side and she was a farmer at heart.\nWe used to have a black and white photo of her wearing a hat and carrying basket and sickle to harvest her crops.\nFor her, no greater joy than cultivating crop and raising farm animals.\nThere was a gathering on August 1990 to celebrate her 80th Birthday. A Family Gathering\nWe got see her extended family, for the first time in nearly 2 decades.\nShe spent time with our family after she turned 90.\nBehind our urban apartment, there was a path that led to a hill and the hiking trail with moderate incline.\nGrandma could out-climb most young people, even in her 90s.\nShe was a devout Christian.\nFrom the time I had left Korea and returned with a family of my own, I hadn’t seen her in nearly 25 years.\nDuring those years her faith in Christ had increased, Christ was the center of her life.\nShe shared life’s lessons with her grandchildren. Also her great grandchildren,\nGrandma passed away, a year after we left Korea. She was nearly 93 years old.\nIt is a common practice to cremate now days in Korea.\nHowever, she was buried in a plot that is owned by my dad’s youngest brother’s in-laws.\nThe in-laws were also from North Korea, and for a time took care of our Grandma near their home in 평택\nI am grateful for her dedication as a faithful Christian.\nShe was a devoted grandmother to us.\nThe best one can hope for."

    "text": "Had a choice to make.\nEither go for a morning hike or try to fix the flat tire.\nChose the flat tire fixing.\nI had some doubts about my ability to do all the steps necessary to remove and replace a flat tire. Sister K said she will take care of it, thinking of me.\nFollowed the saying,\n&gt;Never delegate understanding1\nThe tire was indeed flat, beyond the air level needed for driving.\nThe Plan,\nChange out the tire, drive to the nearest tire shop.\nReasons for my hesitation was realized, plus some unanticipated.\nThe pneumatic tools used at the shop can tighten bolts far stronger than these less than full length wrench tools.\nAfter struggling and figuring out the “throw the weight” approach to loosening the bolt, finally removed 5 requisite bolts, then raised the van sufficiently to remove the tire.\nThen came the next hurdle.\nCouldn’t lift the bench seats to access the spare tire. Two of us struggled for good 10 minutes, and almost gave up.\nCalled our son.\nWhen someone chimed,\nJohn did it in a minute what took me a while. He pulled on both pulleys at the same time.\nThen came the unexpected. Newer vehicles don’t carry spares, to maximize both passenger and cargo space.\nNow I had wished I had brought the portable tire inflator. Was too set on changing to the spare tire and driving to the tire center\nThen my son pointed out that there was indeed tire inflator in the car we drove. Not sure how it got there.\nLearned again not to assume something was present. Check or verify first.\nThe other, perhaps more important lesson was the one given by John. He took time and helped. There were others that passed but didn’t stop.\nIn my younger days, I would have taken time to determine who’s at fault or where to place the blame.\nThat would be the earthly or telestial thing to do.\nThat 1980s poet/singer Howard wrote some decades ago\nIt is a difficult lesson to learn. When we try to explain events of our lives with our limited understanding.\nBut struggle we must, until we realize that sometimes there are no earthly reasons that will explain what has happened.\nWe must turn to other sources for the inspiration and comfort.\nThought of these verses from the Gospel according to John.2\n1 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.\n2 And his disciples asked him, saying,\n3 Jesus answered,\nOr that,"

I could understand English fairly well, having lived in US for 25 years.\nI chose words that I knew and formed expressions that captured the essence of the visitor’s message.\nNumbers in Korea are measured in units of 10,000 or 만(萬) When US based spoke in terms of thousands of dollars, had to make some quick calculations along with remembering prevailing currency exchange rate (1 USD = 1,400 KRW)\nAnother mental hurdle was remembering several units for measuring an area. Metric unit is square meters. However, Koreans use the unit of 평(坪, pyong) when measuring a building or apartment spaces.\n평 is about 3.3 square meters. Or a 6 ft by 6 ft space, or 36 square feet.\nDepending on who was descrbing the space, one had to have those conversion factors memorized.\nAfter a while, however, I no longer relied on the conversion factors. As most missionaries and expats have experienced, I became familiar with the local currency and value of things.\nI would walk into an apartment and think in terms of 평 Recognizing that most popular apartment sizes were in the 30+평 (~1200 feet\\(^{2}\\), 115 meter\\(^{2}\\)) neighborhood.\nLife got easier as adjusted to Korean ways of measuring, reckoning and living.\n\nHowever, after 45 months in the country, we moved back to Utah, our United States home.\nAdjusting to US way of life was easier than expected, except for missing the life in Korea as an expat.\nIn this life, we make sense of things by assigning values and by learning the interpretation of the locals.\nMoreover, there are numerous guides and approach on how to adjust to a new place.\nHowever, we all share the same place of origin. The home that we came from and the same eternal home that we all will return to someday.\nHow or whether we incorporate elements from that home in this life is matter of choice and tradition.\nGrateful for homes that I grew up in with my parents and my sisters, the one I established with Sister K and ones that are being established by my children.\nFor in these homes, I have witnessed and experienced bit of that original home. When no interpretation is necessary, for we all felt that order and harmony.\n\nAs technologies advance further Cultural diffences will be reduced. Language barriers will be eliminated Traditions of our fathers and mothers will be updated and some jetisoned.\n\n…till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;\n\n\nEphesians 4:13\n\n\nFor the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.\n\n\nHabakkuk 2:14"

People will say of you.\n\n사람팔자는 시간문제 [people’s lives (fortunes) are time dependent]\nMy mom couldn’t imagine this scenario. She was struggling to feed the family and pay off the debt incurred when she married 2 of my father’s brothers.\nFurthermore she said, the baby in your womb will be a son and that son will also go overseas and will have the means to study as long as he wishes.\nThough she didn’t believe the HSP, she thanked her.\nYears later, the Honey Selling Philosopher returned. This time it was a much warmer reception and more food and wine.\nBecause my father was working in Vietnam, it meant more cash flow and the debt was shrinking.\nShe made sure, my mom acknowledged her prescience. Having correctly predicted the outcome, she reiterated the part of lasting education for her son.\n\nI have no way of confirming the veracity of this lady or the thigs attributed to her.\nMy father says, he met her once.\nIt may have been a part of toolkit used by moms from that period in Korea.\nWhatever the origin or the intent, its effect has been real.\nBecause she believed, I began to buy in and tried to make it happen.\n\nLikewise, because my mother believed in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, my life has been blessed.\nFrom a life of little prospect in 인천시부평동(仁川市). To a much better life in the United States.\nMy mother and father made it possible.\nFirst through faith in Jesus Christ, from Presbyterianism to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.\nWhether it is a familiar or unfamiliar requirements or commandments, I will follow my parents example."
