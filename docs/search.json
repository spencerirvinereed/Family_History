However, language barriers and scarcity of readily available documents put a stop.\nThe challenge was that these records, if located, were recorded in Chinese.\nI would have learned Chinese, if I had stayed in Korea.\nI tried to learn both spoken and written Chinese. Spoken Mandarin and Traditional and not simplified characters.\nWhile it got me familiar with a grade school level understanding but never further.\nI have a yearning to remember my parents more fully And to fulfill my obligation to put into use what I have been given in terms of education and resources within my sphere.\nI plan to document tools I have, the challenges and struggles and occasional breakthroughs, in coming days.\nAll the best,\nFebruary, 2024, Anno Domini"

Showa Period (昭和時代) and Taisho Era (大正時代)\nIt is quite amazing that she created this and that we were able to locate it.\nAlso have the technology and the language skills nearby to translate this\nAlso a reminder that midst all of the technology, a sheet of paper with a right arrangement of names and dates can capture precious information\nArakiさん, ありがとうございました!\n(Thank you Spencer and Meg for your help)"
