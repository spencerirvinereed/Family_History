Link to details of the escape\nShe settled in the island of 진도.4\nTo make a living, she would travel to 목포시, roughly 15 miles to the north, purchase items that she would sell in an open-air market.\nHowever, after seeing the local women working side by side with men, and not wanting that for her daughters, she moved and joined her relatives in 인천.\nMy earliest memory is that she owned a 슈퍼마켓, in the 동인천 area.\nShe would always treated me kindly and she seemed angelic to me.\nHowever, through her smiles, I could tell she always carried a tinge of sadness.\nBy the time I was born, she had been a widow for nearly 25 years and she endured abrupt change in fortune and had escaped to South with just the family.\nHer faith in Christ carried her through.\nShe seemed frail but she was a strong person.\nI remember we were getting ready to leave for 김포공항.\nShe came and didn’t say much, and we sensed her sadness.\nI recall, she had brought some apples for our journey to America.\nMy mom’s sisters took turn in taking care of Grandma Kim.\nMet her again in 1990, because my aunt 현덕 had taken good care of her, she looked young and healthy, even as she approached 80s.\nShe looked more vibrant and seemed at peace.\nWhen she passed away on November 1999, all of the children had gathered by her side.\nShe had asked for some 감 or persimmons, her favorite\nThe store had closed by then, told her that we would get her some in the morning.\nShe did not make it to morning.\nAt one time she was among the happiest and most blessed women, according to my mom\nMost, if not all, of her material, worldly possession was taken and also her husband.\nShe would live nearly 60 years alone.\nBut she raised 4 daughters and a son to adulthood, married them to fellow North Koreans.\nPlanted in them a faith in Jesus Christ.\nShe taught us by example, for she lived an angel-like life and we have a strong faith that she is united with her husband and the rest of the family."

For a price of 2 movie tickets one could own nearly 50 years of music history in 6 CDs.\n113 songs in all.\nRecently discovered these 2 boxed set and its packaging One box, containing Memories 추억, had this message imprinted.\nMy parents and I often listened to these songs together. My parents knew songs from the first 2 CDs by heart. For they had experienced the stories mentioned in these songs\nThe songs my parents listened in their 20s and 30s.\nAs I listened with them, I could imagine their struggles and understood why these songs were meaningful.\nA combination of words and music that covered what should have been their life’s high moments that became its most disappointing and discouraging moments.\nYet somehow, these songs had a hint of hopeful messages, my parents’ life overcame those challenges and established a family.\nNow my parents are no longer with us. They have finished their mission in this life.\nWonder how often they take break from thinking of us and watching over us.\nEach time I think of them, my appreciation and love for them deepens.\nA spring storm came, the setting sun cast its light towards the mountains and clouds.\nThe confluence of light and clouds, refractions and reflections created rainbows against the Cascade mountain.\nThat rainbow reminded me our lives is a miracle. The relationships are eternal. There are eternal and natural truths\nA fleeting, physical reminder from our parents. A collective message of love and appreciation from the children.\nThank you for teaching and living your lives so that we can traverse this life with a sure knowledge."

    "text": "Chat GPT Explains how rainbow works\nA rainbow is a natural occurrence that happens when sunlight is refracted, or bent, and then reflected inside raindrops. This creates a spectrum of colors in the sky. Here’s how it works:\n\nSunlight: It all begins with sunlight. Sunlight may look white, but it’s actually composed of various colors, from red to violet.\nRefraction: When sunlight encounters raindrops suspended in the air, the light is bent as it enters the droplet. This happens because light travels at different speeds through air and water. As sunlight moves from air into the denser water inside the droplet, it slows down and bends.\nReflection: Once inside the raindrop, the light reflects off the inside surface. It then reflects off the back surface and exits the droplet.\nDispersion: As the light exits the raindrop, it’s spread out into its component colors. This happens because different colors of light bend by different amounts inside the droplet, causing them to separate into a spectrum.\nMultiple Reflections: Some of the dispersed light travels to the observer’s eyes, forming the appearance of a rainbow. The light undergoes multiple reflections inside the raindrop before exiting, causing the different colors to spread out in an arc.\nAngular Dependence: The angle at which the observer sees the rainbow depends on the angle of sunlight entering the raindrops and how the light exits them. This is why rainbows are typically seen when the sun is low and the observer is facing away from it.\n\nIn summary, a rainbow is a beautiful result of sunlight interacting with raindrops and the principles of optics."

    "section": "Risk Priority Number: Courtesy of GPT",
    "text": "Risk Priority Number: Courtesy of GPT\nRPN, or Risk Priority Number, is a numerical value used in Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to prioritize potential failure modes based on their severity, occurrence likelihood, and detectability. Here’s how RPN is determined:\n\nSeverity (S): Severity refers to the potential impact or consequences of a failure mode on the system, process, or product being analyzed. It’s typically assessed on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 representing negligible impact and 10 representing catastrophic impact. The severity rating reflects the seriousness of the consequences if the failure were to occur.\nOccurrence (O): Occurrence evaluates the likelihood or frequency of a failure mode occurring within the given system, process, or product. It’s also rated on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 indicating rare occurrence and 10 indicating almost certain occurrence. The occurrence rating reflects the probability of the failure happening.\nDetection (D): Detection assesses the likelihood of detecting the failure mode before it leads to negative consequences. Like severity and occurrence, it’s rated on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 indicating very high detectability and 10 indicating very low detectability. The detection rating reflects the effectiveness of current detection methods or controls in place.\n\nTo determine the Risk Priority Number (RPN) for a specific failure mode, you simply multiply the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings together:\n\\[ RPN = Severity×Occurrence×Detection \\]\nThe resulting RPN provides a single numerical value that represents the relative risk associated with that particular failure mode. Higher RPN values indicate higher priority for addressing that failure mode because they represent combinations of more severe consequences, higher likelihood of occurrence, and lower detectability.\nRPNs help prioritize resources and efforts toward mitigating or eliminating the most critical failure modes to improve the overall reliability, safety, and quality of the system, process, or product being analyzed."

    "text": "FMEA Steps: Courtesy of GPT\nFMEA, or Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, is a systematic approach used to identify and prioritize potential failure modes within a process, product, or system, and to understand the potential effects of those failures. Here’s a breakdown of the process:\n\nScope Definition: Identify the process, product, or system to be analyzed. Define the boundaries and objectives of the analysis.\nTeam Formation: Assemble a cross-functional team with members who have diverse expertise related to the process or product being analyzed. This team typically includes engineers, designers, quality experts, and relevant stakeholders.\nIdentification of Failure Modes: Brainstorm and list all possible failure modes that could occur within the chosen process or system. A failure mode is any way in which a process or product could fail to meet its intended purpose or function.\nDetermination of Effects: For each identified failure mode, determine the potential effects or consequences of that failure. These effects can range from minor inconveniences to serious safety hazards or financial losses.\nAssignment of Severity Ratings: Assign a severity rating to each failure mode based on the potential consequences. Severity ratings typically range from 1 to 10, with higher numbers indicating more severe consequences.\nIdentification of Causes: Determine the root causes or mechanisms behind each failure mode. This involves analyzing the factors that could lead to the occurrence of the failure.\nAssignment of Occurrence Ratings: Estimate the likelihood or frequency of each failure mode occurring. Occurrence ratings are typically assigned on a scale from 1 to 10, with higher numbers indicating a higher likelihood of occurrence.\nAssignment of Detection Ratings: Assess the likelihood of detecting each failure mode before it leads to a negative consequence. Detection ratings are also typically assigned on a scale from 1 to 10, with higher numbers indicating a higher likelihood of detection.\nCalculation of Risk Priority Numbers (RPN): Calculate the Risk Priority Number for each failure mode by multiplying the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings together (RPN = Severity × Occurrence × Detection).\nPrioritization and Action Planning: Prioritize the identified failure modes based on their RPNs. Focus on addressing the failure modes with the highest RPNs first. Develop action plans to mitigate or eliminate these high-priority failure modes, which may involve design changes, process improvements, or additional quality controls.\nImplementation of Corrective Actions: Implement the action plans developed to address the high-priority failure modes. Monitor the effectiveness of these actions and make adjustments as necessary.\nContinuous Improvement: FMEA is an iterative process. Regularly review and update the analysis as new information becomes available or as changes are made to the process or product. This helps to ensure ongoing quality improvement and risk management."

Or a 6 ft by 6 ft space, or 36 square feet.\nDepending on who was descrbing the space, one had to have those conversion factors memorized.\nAfter a while, however, I no longer relied on the conversion factors.\nAs most missionaries and expats have experienced, I became familiar with the local currency and value of things.\nI would walk into an apartment and think in terms of 평 Recognizing that most popular apartment sizes were in the 30+평 (~1200 feet\\(^{2}\\), 115 meter\\(^{2}\\)) neighborhood.\nLife got easier as adjusted to Korean ways of measuring, reckoning and living.\n\nIn this life, we make sense of things by assigning values and by learning the interpretation of the locals.\nMoreover, there are numerous guides and approach on how to adjust to a new place, written by visitors and locals alike.\nHowever, we all share the memories and reminders of the same place of origin.\nThe home that we came from and the same eternal home that we all will return to someday.\nHow or whether we incorporate elements from that home in this life is matter of choice and tradition.\nLook forward to a time when no interpretation is necessary, due to advancements in technology and by embracing traditions that bring us together.\nFor we all have felt that order and harmony – at times in our lives.\n\nTraditions of our fathers and mothers will be updated and some jettisoned.\n\n…till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;\n\n\nEphesians 4:13\n\n\nFor the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.\n\n\nHabakkuk 2:14"

Sister K said she will take care of it, thinking of me.\nFollowed the saying,\n&gt;Never delegate understanding1\nThe tire was indeed flat, beyond the air level needed for driving.\nThe Plan,\nChange out the tire, drive to the nearest tire shop.\nReasons for my hesitation was realized, plus some unanticipated.\nThe pneumatic tools used at the shop can tighten bolts far stronger than these less than full length wrench tools.\nAfter struggling and figuring out the “throw the weight” approach to loosening the bolt, finally removed 5 requisite bolts, then raised the van sufficiently to remove the tire.\nThen came the next hurdle.\nCouldn’t lift the bench seats to access the spare tire. Two of us struggled for good 10 minutes, and almost gave up.\nCalled our son.\nWhen someone chimed,\nJohn did it in a minute what took me a while. He pulled on both pulleys at the same time.\nThen came the unexpected. Newer vehicles don’t carry spares, to maximize both passenger and cargo space.\nNow I had wished I had brought the portable tire inflator. Was too set on changing to the spare tire and driving to the tire center\nThen my son pointed out that there was indeed tire inflator in the car we drove. Not sure how it got there.\nLearned again not to assume something was present. Check or verify first.\nThe other, perhaps more important lesson was the one given by John. He took time and helped. There were others that passed but didn’t stop.\nIn my younger days, I would have taken time to determine who’s at fault or where to place the blame.\nThat would be the earthly or telestial thing to do.\nThat 1980s poet/singer Howard wrote some decades ago\nIt is a difficult lesson to learn. When we try to explain events of our lives with our limited understanding.\nBut struggle we must, until we realize that sometimes there are no earthly reasons that will explain what has happened.\nWe must turn to other sources for the inspiration and comfort.\nThought of these verses from the Gospel according to John.2\n1 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.\n2 And his disciples asked him, saying,\n3 Jesus answered,\nOr that,"

    "text": "Koreans like to hike.\nThere are fashionable outfits and clubs of all types to accommodate all levels of hikers.\nBut to older Koreans, going to mountains is more than a hike.\nMy mother-in-law loved mountains. Especially in spring time when wild vegetation yields some of the best harvest of fresh vegetable.\nRecall, climbing mountains around Provo and Sandy searching for these plants.\nIt seems they are almost cultivated, since they are confined to certain locations year after year\nFond recollection of carrying an empty trash bag up. Then harvesting a bag or two full of 취나물1\nThese are delicacies that enhances 비빔밥\nIn later years, her arthritis prevented her from returning to these coveted places.\nOlder Koreans also prefer, indirect communications, when given a choice between direct and indirect.\nIt may not be the most efficient means of communication, a one-upmanship of saying the most distant message and still get the message across.\nOne day, my mother–in-law mentioned,\nWe didn’t understand her words.\nFinally understood that she wanted to climb the Y-Mountain.\nWe had to figure out a way to get her up on the trail and climb to the 6266 feet level from the 5164 feet starting point2\nVarious ideas\nFinally settled on the combo bike trailer, made as a children stroller.\nThe team was assembled on an early May morning.\nFifteen of her descendants pushed and pulled her up to the top of the letter Y.\nWe are not sure if she wanted to look for wild vegetables, since she didn’t say it directly.\nWith the passing of that generation of Koreans, we are losing the ability to learn about edible mountain provided vegetables.\nPerhaps, it is to be expected, since most substitute items are available either locally or through mail-order. More directly, the hunger and the need to live off nature’s offering is no longer necessary.\nHowever, the joy of carrying around a sack and a chance to harvest, to provide independently is nearly lost.\nWant to thank that generation for showing how to live (survive) and thrive, by relying on the source of all Providences."

In the context of today’s technology-savvy teenagers, a filmstrip might be described as follows: Imagine a visual story told through a series of rectangular images, like the frames on Instagram stories, but in a linear format. Each frame depicts a scene or moment from the story, accompanied by text or captions to convey dialogue, narration, or additional context. The images are vibrant and dynamic, resembling the high-definition visuals found in movies and TV shows, but condensed into smaller, easily digestible segments. Think of it as a mini-movie that you can scroll through with your fingertips.↩︎\nExodus 20:12↩︎"

One of the equipment to run its factory was sourced from Utah, where I was working. I was chosen along with several other engineers to support that transfer.\nMy first trip to a country, other than Korea and US. The experience was more than I had read about and heard from people that have traveled there. More than I could have imagined\nIndeed, classical saying is\nAbove heaven, below Suzhou and Hangzhou.\nDecided to pursue studying the language. The course at SLCC (Salt Lake Community College) was taught by a gentleman from 桂林市2\nMade some progress but gave up learning at an regularly scheduled intervals.\nMet other individuals that encouraged me. Including Pat Geraghty who quoted a study,\nRecently, had a dinner with a neighbor. We had known them since school days as newly wed families. We were welcoming their son who was recently married. The husband and wife both worked at Family Search\nShowed these 2 books to them.\nThey immediately gave a historical and practical overview and lesson on how to access these records."

A Family Gathering\nWe got see her extended family, for the first time in nearly 2 decades.\nShe spent time with our family after she turned 90.\nBehind our urban apartment, there was a path that led to a hill and the hiking trail with moderate incline.\nGrandma could out-climb most young people, even in her 90s.\nShe was a devout Christian.\nFrom the time I had left Korea and returned with a family of my own, I hadn’t seen her in nearly 25 years.\nDuring those years her faith in Christ had increased, Christ was the center of her life.\nShe shared life’s lessons with her grandchildren. Also her great grandchildren,\nGrandma passed away, a year after we left Korea. She was nearly 93 years old.\nIt is a common practice to cremate now days in Korea.\nHowever, she was buried in a plot that is owned by my dad’s youngest brother’s in-laws.\nThe in-laws were also from North Korea, and for a time took care of our Grandma near their home in 평택\nI am grateful for her dedication as a faithful Christian.\nShe was a devoted grandmother to us.\nThe best one can hope for."
