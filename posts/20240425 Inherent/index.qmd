Once at an art/photo gallery in Park City, saw the evening shot of the Horseshoe Bend

Commented that the place doesn't look like the photo.

The person next to me stated, the place indeed look like the photo.

The cloud in the photo and the color was exceptional, almost out of this world.

If that is what is inherent to the sight.

I doubt, to 99.9% of the visitors will see that sight.

What is inherent in that location can be enhanced.

Once you bring in elements foreign to that location, is it still an accurate representation.

Make up vs alterations.

World of CGI **Computer-generated imagery**

**in a natural or innate manner, inherent**

innate **existing in, belonging to, or determined by factors present in an individual from birth**

intrinsic belonging naturally; essential.

World of Food

Sauce generated taste

Not what is intrinsic to the food.

Then what point are we tasting the sauce vs food.

Innate, rarely excites

Enhanced - tie to the orginal

Altered beyond recognition

Nature doesn't enhance, nor does it alter.

Or does it?
