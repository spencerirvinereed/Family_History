### Older Me

That was a good milkshake, that made me think of...Bananas, ice cream and milk.  
Growing up in Korea, about 10 years after the Korean War, I seldom saw those items let alone taste them

For a long time, I thought bananas were all green colored, since that was only ones I saw as a child.

Eating bananas and milk daily seemed like a dream
Having some ice cream was out of the question.

Then we became less poor, after my father returned from 4 years in Vietnam

Each day a bottle of milk (guessing it was less than 10 ounces) was delivered to our home. My sisters and I took turns devising ways to divide the amount equitably

I wished for a time and place where one could have these items in abundance

Fast forward a decade I could buy and eat all 3 items in one sitting

Now that they are readily available, I no longer value them as I used to.

Are we talking about the global supply chain of bananas and the dairy production in Korea. 
Or was is there a life’s lesson?

I can’t relate to it and don’t see its relevance in my life.

### Older Me

When life’s basics are not met people will cling to God, governments and will foster family and follow traditions. 

But as soon as necessities become plentiful and people are blessed, people will soon go searching for their own missions and try to set new traditions.

Like people of Moses’ days, and Nephite people after Nephi and Jacob. 

Also Apostle Paul spoke of last days as being perilous times.^[https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=DIV2&byte=5265727] 

>adjective. involving or full of grave risk or peril; hazardous; dangerous

### Older Me

Even so, I don’t want to go back to the 60s or the 70s in Korea. 
Nor days of trying to learn English as an immigrant, when I wished I could speak like other students in the 6th Grade. 

My daily routine consisted of attending a remedial one-on-one class or consigned to a corner desk with a divider to learn on my own with a tape recorder.

But there was something meaningful about understanding and accepting traditions and challenges set forth --- even with its limitations and attendant frustrations. 

Also accepting poverty and wishing and looking forward to better days. 

It helped that all were poor together, went to church not necessarily for sermons but for handouts, and advertising of life's luxuries and sources of information was limited to newspapers and radios.

Now the internet and all its permutations makes it easy to compare lives, compete with others, and consume any and all of life’s offerings and more.

It can be called the most challenging time yet we have limitless possibilities.

We all have choices to make and follow through, and fulfill manifested dreams.

Btw, what is this tradition you keep referring to, has it guided your life?

### Older Me

Understanding, conforming, and dedication to the 10 Commandments and various interpretations, localizations, and modernized versions of it.

### 손자/孫子

Can you give some examples of localized and modernized versions?

### Older Me

Each culture has developed its set of rules or norms.
Often adapting and sharing with neighbors and conquered people.

Think of Buddhism from India, through China then Korea and Japan.
Confucianism from China to parts of Asia and the West.
Islam from Saudi Arabia to Asia and beyond.

It seems to be the beginning was difficult and often rejected at the origin.

> But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.^[Mattew 13:57, KJV]

### Older Me

That is an interesting observation.
Often, the ones that receive these truths are able to refine the original concepts.
And adopt core concept and adjust local customs and traditions.

### 손자/孫子

Is it still relevant?

### Older Me

What do you think?
That is for you and your generation to consider and decide.

I will have another milk shake.
Good night.
