Koreans like mysteries.

Especially when it comes to communication. More meandering, collateral, the higher the indirect score.

My mother-in-law loves mountains. Especially in spring time when wild vegetation yields some of the best harvest of fresh vegetable.

Recall, climbing mountains around Provo and Sandy searching for these plants. It seems they are almost cultivated, since they are confined to certain locations year after year

Fond recollection of carrying an emply trash bag up. Then harvesting a bag or two full of 취나물[^1]

In later years, her arthritis prevented her from returning to these coveted places.

Then one day, she mentioned,

> Wonder what the view of the valley would be from that location on the mountain?

We didn't understand her words.

Finally understood that she wanted to climb the Y-Mountain.

Why didn't she say so.

We had to figure out a way to get her up on the trail and climb to the 6266 feet level from the 5164 feet starting point[^2]

Various ideas

What are parables

In the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible, the passage explaining why Jesus spoke in parables can be found in Matthew 13:10-17:

"And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?

He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.

For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.

Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.

And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:

For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.

But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.

For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them."
