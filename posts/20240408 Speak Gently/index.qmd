Koreans like to hike.

There are fashionable outfits and clubs of all types to accommodate all levels of hikers.

But to older Koreans, going to mountains is more than a hike.

My mother-in-law loved mountains. 
Especially in spring time when wild vegetation yields some of the best harvest of fresh vegetable.

Recall, climbing mountains around Provo and Sandy searching for these plants.

It seems they are almost cultivated, since they are confined to certain locations year after year

Fond recollection of carrying an empty trash bag up. 
Then harvesting a bag or two full of 취나물[^1]

These are delicacies that enhances 비빔밥

In later years, her arthritis prevented her from returning to these coveted places.

Older Koreans also prefer, indirect communications, when given a choice between direct and indirect.

It may not be the most efficient means of communication, a one-upmanship of saying the most distant message and still get the message across.

One day, my mother–in-law mentioned,

> Wonder what the view of the valley would be from a location on the mountain?

We didn't understand her words.

> Is direct communication is the quickest and a surest way to communicate?
>
> It is if the delivery is to maximized for efficiency.

Finally understood that she wanted to climb the Y-Mountain.

We had to figure out a way to get her up on the trail and climb to the 6266 feet level from the 5164 feet starting point[^2]

Various ideas

-   Take turns carrying her on our backs
-   Garden trailer
-   Gurney or stretcher

Finally settled on the combo bike trailer, made as a children stroller.

The team was assembled on an early May morning.

Fifteen of her descendants pushed and pulled her up to the top of the letter Y.

We are not sure if she wanted to look for wild vegetables, since she didn't say it directly.

With the passing of that generation of Koreans, we are losing the ability to learn about edible mountain provided vegetables.

Perhaps, it is to be expected, since most substitute items are available either locally or through mail-order.
More directly, the hunger and the need to live off nature's offering is no longer necessary.

However, the joy of carrying around a sack and a chance to harvest, to provide independently is nearly lost.

Want to thank that generation for showing how to live (survive) and thrive, by relying on the source of all Providences.
