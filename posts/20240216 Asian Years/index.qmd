There were others that died in their infancy.

When both his older brother and his father became casualties of the war, my father became the de facto bread winner and the head of the household in his teenage years.

He learned skills as young person, as well as becoming fluent in Japanese

He became a sewer of furniture.

When the Japanese retreated after the WW2, my father became an owner of a house – at age 15.

He tells of a time, growing up in 안변 area of Korea.

He would catch fish, with a bare hand and would trim trees in the mountains to provide cash for the family.

He recalls seeing an automobile for the first.

He ran and got out of the way as quickly as possible.

He would later not only drive it but learn to operate a heavy equipment that became his vocation.
