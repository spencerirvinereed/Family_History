Had a choice to make.\
Either go for a morning hike or try to fix the flat tire.\
Chose the flat tire fixing.

I had some doubts about my ability to do all the steps necessary to remove and replace a flat tire. Sister K said she will take care of it, thinking of me.

Followed the saying,\
>Never delegate understanding[^1]

[^1]: Charles Eames

The tire was indeed flat, beyond the air level needed for driving.

The Plan,\
Change out the tire, drive to the nearest tire shop.

Reasons for my hesitation was realized, plus some unanticipated.

The pneumatic tools used at the shop can tighten bolts far stronger than these less than full length wrench tools.

After struggling and figuring out the "throw the weight" approach to loosening the bolt, finally removed 5 requisite bolts, then raised the van sufficiently to remove the tire.

Then came the next hurdle.

Couldn't lift the bench seats to access the spare tire. Two of us struggled for good 10 minutes, and almost gave up.

Called our son.

When someone chimed,

> What do you need help with?

John did it in a minute what took me a while. He pulled on both pulleys at the same time.

Then came the unexpected. Newer vehicles don't carry spares, to maximize both passenger and cargo space.

Now I had wished I had brought the portable tire inflator. Was too set on changing to the spare tire and driving to the tire center

Then my son pointed out that there was indeed tire inflator in the car we drove. Not sure how it got there.

Learned again not to assume something was present. Check or verify first.

The other, perhaps more important lesson was the one given by John. He took time and helped. There were others that passed but didn't stop.

In my younger days, I would have taken time to determine who's at fault or where to place the blame.

That would be the earthly or telestial thing to do.

That 1980s poet/singer Howard wrote some decades ago

> You can look at the menu, but you just can't eat\
> You can feel the cushions, but you can't have a seat\
> You can dip your foot in the pool, but you can't have a swim\
> You can feel the punishment, but you can't commit the sin

> And you want her, and she wants you\
> We want everyone\
> And you want her and she wants you\
> No one, no one, no one ever is to blame

-   No One is to Blame
-   Howard Jones, 1985

It is a difficult lesson to learn. When we try to explain events of our lives with our limited understanding.

But struggle we must, until we realize that sometimes there are no earthly reasons that will explain what has happened.

We must turn to other sources for the inspiration and comfort.

Thought of these verses from the Gospel according to John.[^2]

[^2]: King James Version

1 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.

2 And his disciples asked him, saying,

> Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?

3 Jesus answered,

> Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.

Or that,

> This happened so that Godâ€™s work might be revealed in him[^3]

[^3]: International Standard Version
