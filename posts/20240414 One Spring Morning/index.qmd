The local FM Station was playing Aram Khachaturian's `Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia`

Sister K and I had just hiked the cloud capped nearby hills.
The air was extra crisp and clean due to overnight rain.

All flowers are blooming.

This is spring in Utah.

Felt blissful

There must have been a big bang of melodies.
Some are still floating, looking for sponsors

But like a partygoer that arrives on time yet rest of guests are fashionably late,
spring leaves...

Winter rain was back as I turned into 800 North or Canyon Parkway.
