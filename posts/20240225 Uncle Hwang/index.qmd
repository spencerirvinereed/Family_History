There must been a big celebration in the 황 family.

When Uncle Hwang (황태민) was born.

The nation was celebrating the liberation from the colonial era.

Things must have looked up for everyone.

This was not to last for the Hwang (黃) family

Their father would pass away within 6 months at the age 35.

Communism would spread and take away nearly all their possessions.

Then in 5 years, the north (where they lived) and the south would be at war.

Uncle Hwang had the movie star good looks and was a gentle person.

Until alcohol consumption led to his own early death.

I remember, grandma Kim would always tried to protect him.
