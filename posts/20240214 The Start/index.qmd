Throughout my life, I have been asked to update my family history.

Each time, I had the same response,

> Both of my parents are from North Korea and there are no family records and there is no way to access them.

That allowed me to avoid the responsibility.

However, it wasn't entirely true.

We have had access to the following

-   Family register (호적등본)

-   Huang family genealogy - 黃氏世譜 - 황씨 가문의 계보

-   My family genealogy - 자랑스런 나의족보

-   Oriental Chronology - 東洋年表 - 동양 연대기

-   Everyday Chinese Dictionary - 活用玉篇 - 활용옥편

[In addition, there are growing genealogical sources on line in Korea and in United States].

So rather than do nothing, I plan to use the resources that are available, to identify and document both Kang and Hwang ancestors.

Hoping that Ether 12:27 applies to this effort as well.
