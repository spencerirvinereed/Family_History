I am the son of 

- 강은섭 姜銀燮 (1930-2020)
- 황현실 黃賢實 (1932-2023)

I have always wanted to find and document family records.
However, language barriers and scarcity of readily available documents put a stop.

The challenge was that these records, if located, were recorded in Chinese.

I would have learned Chinese, if I had stayed in Korea.

I tried to learn both spoken and written Chinese. Spoken Mandarin and Traditional and not simplified characters. 

While it got me familiar with a grade school level understanding but never further.

I have a yearning to remember my parents more fully
And to fulfill my obligation to put into use what I have been given in terms of education and resources within my sphere.

I plan to document tools I have, the challenges and struggles and occasional breakthroughs, in coming days.

All the best,
