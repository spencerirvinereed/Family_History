Grandma Kim (the wife of 황운학) had a very difficult life.

When young, she was the envy of her neighbors.

A bride from the big city, married to a well to do merchant.

She would wear the latest fashion, instead of the traditional 한복

Then as often the case, tides change, and very quickly.

She went from a landowner to serf within 3 to 4 years as communism replaced capitalism

Grandpa and Grandma were landowners and business minded persons.

They owned orchards, Grandpa would venture out to big cities to acquire new items

They operated 협성 상회

A branch of 매일신문

later she became more devout.

I remember the day we left for America, she came.

Not much was said, she had brought a bag of apples.

For the long journey ahead, or did she remember that those were my favorite fruit

When she passed away in November 1999, she had asked for some 감 or persimmons.

The store had closed by then, told her that we would get her some in the morning.

She did not make it to morning.

Fearing this my wife had preserved some 감 when my mother had become ill.

Met her again in 1990, because my aunt 황현덕 had taken good care of her, she looked young and healthy, even as she approached 80s.

Got to meet her 2 daughters that lived by her in 인천.
