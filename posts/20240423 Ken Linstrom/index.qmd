A co-worker said,

>There are no easy things left anymore

Ken said this at the turn of the century.

He had been with the company for couple of decades and had seen it grow from a local medical device to a worldwide operation. 

He had the perspective.

This was enabled through a purchase by a multi-national company based in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.

Initially, IV (Intravenous) Catheters were assembled by hand.
Among Korean immigrants, the place was affectionately called "바늘공장"
One that offered competitive salary with above average benefits package.

In fact, they offered, company funded Pension Package, in addition to the employee initiated and managed 401K plans

Imagine, the work of Ken, the lead mechanic was probably simpler in the days of manual processes.
However, with the introduction of the high speed equipment, Ken's world became more complicated and demanded skill set he had not prepared for.

He could have used the term, 

>the best of times and worst of times.

But since then, the world has gained a numerous tools.

- cell phones
- internet


Ken, with his perspective, able to compare, accept then endure.

Me, as a new hire, had no means to compare.
I accepted, endured, and then given the opportunity to compare

Now that I have more experience than Ken, how do I describe the current affairs

I agree with Ken's assessment,

There are no easy things left.
But we are also given tools that no other generations had access to.
