My father moved from upper NorthEast Korea to Seoul Area.
My guess is that he move here when he was around 12.

Because by the time the Japanese retreated after 1945, he had acquired a house.
He would have been 15 years old at the time.

He was captured 3 times by the North Korean,
Each time he thought his life was over

One time the leader of North Korean Army said,

나이는 좋은대 세월을 못만난다.

He escaped by running toward North Korean side.

All this happended before he was 21.
