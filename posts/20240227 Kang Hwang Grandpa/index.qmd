I have not met either one of my grandfathers: not yet.

However, through stories that my parents told in conjunction with what I see in my parents and their siblings, I can piece together what type of persons they were.

Ye shall know them by their fruits.  Matthew 7:16
Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you... Joshua 1:3

What I know about them is due to my father and my mother telling about their lives.

By the time I was born, my family had not heard from or seen both of my grandfathers for nearly 20 years.

Everything I know about them, I have heard from my mother or my father.

Both was taken from the family.

One due to illness, the other to pursue his dreams

Contrasts

One from the prosperous west coast, near capital city.

The other from the east coast mountainous area

One stuck in the past, one looking towards progress.

One succumbed to the day to day, seeking pleasure

The other giving up pleasure to build more lasting

The other grandfather traveled to 인천 (Incheon) and gathered goods to be sold at his store.

One time grandpa took my mother to a higher location and showed her the extent of their land holdings.

Men can take the road of building or spending

There are spectrum and men wind up some where in between

One grandfather was definitely a builder, the other a spender

In their absence, children need guidance.

Two extremes of spectrum

Tend to one's responsibility

Children need the presence and guidance of their parents

As Sister K says

> We need to know our roles and not be removed.
>
> 자리를 지키다.

Work at home is not manifested for many years.

But it is manifested through children

Both in looks and actions.
