Worked with Roger G. He was a Program Manager, a veteran, a Marine.

He ran the program like a military. I was Program's Engineering Manager.

Roger had many roles such as Program Planning, Execution and Meetings with Customers, the Defense Contract Management Agency

The one role I remember most, is when we had questions about whether something was in-scope or out-of-scope.

This was important, since the program was Cost-Plus, if in scope, we would be paid for the effort.

Used to wonder how he knew for sure and gave a clear answer. He knew his program and therefore its scope.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

He lived in the world that formulated and answered these questions\^\[**TOC Thinking Processes & Philosophy,** <https://www.tocinstitute.org/theory-of-constraints.html>\]

-   What to change

<!-- -->

-   What to change to

-   How to cause the change

VS

How would he answer these question?

-   What to keep

-   What was the original intent

-   How far to go back or keep as is

Perhaps, both progress made with changes and holding onto old principles meet in the same location

The place where it all started, the beginning

My parents knowledge complemented Roger's

There scope of understanding and knowledge began where Roger's ended.

Through their trials and experiences, they gathered practical knowledges.

Ways to formulate questions and provide answers for both temporal and spiritual issues.

While they knew the answer immediately, they would take their time in answering.

Whereas Roger gave a direct, no-sides-considered answer, my parents would deliberate.

Taking our side, for the sake of broadening our understanding.

They would defend both sides and provided reasoning that supported both premises.

Then from those 2 propositions, we could make decisions.

When they gave their recommendation, it was both satisfying and re-assuring.

Here are some keys to distinguish

God given mandate, guidance, or commandments are gifts not boundaries or limitations.

By their fruits ye shall know them[^1]

[^1]: Matthew 7:16-20, KJV

Gamaliel's advice in Acts 5:38,39

> 38 Therefore, in the present case I advise you:
>
> Leave these men alone!
>
> Let them go!
>
> For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail.
>
> 39 But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men;
>
> you will only find yourselves fighting against God.‚Äù

What has lasted? What would happen to today's practice, if left to continue.

Roger knew his program and the end goal He was not distracted and he clearly stated whether something belonged or not. We should have the same acumen

My parents helped me with these set of questions and guidelines

-   Is the traditions of our fathers and mothers worth keeping?

-   Was it created by man or is it from God?

-   The source of faith and grace or gift that bridges the what was, what is now, and what we desire to be

In public life above questions,

but in personal life how would we answer
