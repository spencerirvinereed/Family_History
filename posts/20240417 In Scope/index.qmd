Worked with Roger G.

He was the Program Manager, a veteran, a Marine.

He ran the program like a military.

I was Program's Engineering Manager.

Roger had many roles such as Program Planning, Execution and Meetings with Customers, the Defense Contract Management Agency

The one role I remember most, is when we had questions about whether something was in-scope or out-of-scope.

This was important, since the program was Cost-Plus, if in scope, we would be paid for the effort.

Used to wonder how he knew for sure and gave a clear answer.

He knew his program and therefore its scope.

In this life, it is seldom that we know the end point and the boundaries, as Roger did.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

He lived in the world that formulated and answered these questions\^\[**TOC Thinking Processes & Philosophy,** <https://www.tocinstitute.org/theory-of-constraints.html>\]

-   What to change
-   What to change to
-   How to cause the change

However, how would he answer these related question?

-   What to keep

-   What was the original intent

-   How far to go back and how much deviation from the original is allowed?

## Remaining questions

Is it possible that both the progress made with changes and holding onto old principles meet in the same location

## My Parents as Program Managers

Though my parents spoke more softly than Roger, they were equally clear and certain whether the issue was relevant in their lives.

If so, they knew which side they chose and communicated their reasoning, unlike Roger, who only gave answers and no explanations for his decision.

They had an ability to understand various issues, not because of expert knowledge.

But because they experienced most difficult situations and dealt people of all types.

Upon meeting a person, they immediately formulated their opinions and they were correct in their assessment.

The place where it all started, the beginning

My parents knowledge complemented Roger's

There scope of understanding and knowledge began where Roger's ended.

Through their trials and experiences, they gathered practical knowledges.

Ways to formulate questions and provide answers for both temporal and spiritual issues.

While they knew the answer immediately, they would take their time in answering.

Not all changes are progress.

Likewise not all progresses due to changes but due to keeping the status quo.

The wisdom is knowing and separating what to keep and what to change.

My parents were masters at this.

\[10\] For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. \[11\] **If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone?** or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?

Whereas Roger gave a direct, no-sides-considered answer, my parents would deliberate.

Taking our side, for the sake of broadening our understanding.

They would defend both sides and provided reasoning that supported both premises.

Then from those 2 propositions, we could make decisions.

When they gave their recommendation, it was both satisfying and re-assuring.

Here are some keys to distinguish

God given mandate, guidance, or commandments are gifts not boundaries or limitations.

By their fruits ye shall know them[^1]

[^1]: Matthew 7:16-20, KJV

Gamaliel's advice in Acts 5:38,39

> 38 Therefore, in the present case I advise you:
>
> Leave these men alone!
>
> Let them go!
>
> For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail.
>
> 39 But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men;
>
> you will only find yourselves fighting against God.‚Äù

What has lasted? What would happen to today's practice, if left to continue.

Roger knew his program and the end goal He was not distracted and he clearly stated whether something belonged or not. We should have the same acumen

My parents helped me with these set of questions and guidelines

-   Is the traditions of our fathers and mothers worth keeping?

-   Was it created by man or is it from God?

-   The source of faith and grace or gift that bridges the what was, what is now, and what we desire to be

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In public life above questions,

but in personal life how would we answer
