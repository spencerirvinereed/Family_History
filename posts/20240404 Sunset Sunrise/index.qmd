Been to a number of wedding this season.
It is spring time in the northern hemisphere.

Any words of wisdom?
Can I ease their load

They must learn from another.

Sunset as a marker

Took for granted, eventual rise of the sun
No longer

Bit of letting go,
The things of the world beckons, stay a littile while longer
Watch another event, an analysis of an event.
Learn another skill.
See another post.

But retire to bed we do
for the renewal and rebirth.

Benefits of living along the Wasatch Front are many.

Abundance of hiking trails that minutes away.

Afford a view of setting sun against fixed markers, lakes and mountains, occasionally clouds

There is a celestial phenomenon, more rare
This eclipse occurs regularly
While the scaricity may make the eclipse more newsworthy and draw people.

Because it is regular and predictable should not make daily sunset any less phenominal or amazing.
