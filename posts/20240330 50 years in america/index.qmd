## People, Places, and Times

Visited a number of places and met a number of people.

Vast majority of trips abroad were part of business transactions.

Paid for, time granted and business lessons to be learned

Seemingly random events,

But were they.

So when people share their travels to thus far unheard of unvisited places, what is my response

Do I spend my own time and money?

Is brief encounter with fellow travelers and meeting regulars worth it?

It is increasingly easier to give the answer. No

Aside from economics of the exchange of my time and money, there is a comfort factor.

Home and its surroundings are familiar and comfortable.

Yet the call to adventure is a regular and inescapable call.

Here are some adventures from the past 50 years in the United States of America.

## Confined geographically

Did not leave the eastern seaboard for the first 10 years, let alone abroad.

The first time visiting places west of Mississippi was when entering the MTC and then subsequent service in the California, Los Angeles area.

The first trip abroad was back to Korea after marriage, some 16 years after leaving Korea

## Recent Reminders

Watched Refugee Music Program.

Made me think of my own arrival in America.

How we were led to here.

Parents made us feel that we were meant to be here.

Always economically or spiritually fed.

Never worried about the future.

Thought of Suzanne Li,

She must have been on internship at Springhill Lake Elementary School.

She encouraged me by sending letters even after her internship was over.
