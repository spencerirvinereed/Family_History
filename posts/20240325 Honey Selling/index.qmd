If my mom had her wish, I would have been an accordion playing doctor. 

She explained that her family has generations of doctors, both Western or Oriental (한의사 韓医師).

Then she recognized my lack of interest or talent.

She changed her approach.

She began telling of the `Honey Seller`

A long time ago, before I was born, a lady selling honey stopped by.

She asked for food and wine.

Thanking my mom, she told about her self.

After losing her husband at an young age, she entered a buddist monastery and studied philosophy (哲學, 철학).

Then she began to ask some questions about my mom.

Her birthday, specifically her birth hour, and that of my father.

She was using the well established and utilized practice of 사주팔자(四柱八字)'

The `Honey Selling Philospher` (HSP) then said,

>In coming days, your husband will go overseas.
People will say of you.

사람팔자는 시간문제
[people's lives (fortunes) are time dependent]

My mom couldn't imagine this scenario.
She was struggling to feed the family and pay off the debt incurred when she married 2 of my father's brothers.

Furthermore she said, the baby in your womb will be a son and that son will also go overseas and will have the means to study as long as he wishes.

Though she didn't believe the HSP, she thanked her.

Years later, the `Honey Selling Philosopher` returned.
This time it was a much warmer reception and more food and wine.

Because my father was working in Vietnam, it meant more cash flow and the debt was shrinking.

She made sure, my mom acknowledged her prescience.
Having correctly predicted the outcome, she reiterated the part of lasting education for her son.

I have no way of confirming the veracity of this lady or the thigs attributed to her.

My father says, he met her once.

It may have been a part of toolkit used by moms from that 
period in Korea.

Whatever the origin or the intent, its effect has been real.

Because she believed, I began to buy in and tried to make it happen.

Likewise, because my mother believed in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, my life has been blessed.

From a life of little prospect in 인천시부평동(仁川市).
To a much better life in the United States.

My mother and father made it possible.

First through faith in Jesus Christ, from Presbyterianism to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

Whether it is a familiar or unfamiliar requirements or commandments, I will follow my parents example.
