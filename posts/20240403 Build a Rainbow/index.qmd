"Imagine a device that looks like a small rectangular box, similar in size to a smartphone but thicker. Instead of a touchscreen, it has buttons and switches for controlling playback. You insert a plastic cassette tape into a slot on the front of the device.

This cassette tape contains a long, thin strip of magnetic tape wound between two spools. When you press play, the tape moves past a magnetic playback head inside the player, producing sound. You can adjust the volume using a dial or buttons on the device."

We used this device, along with the film strip projector[^1]

[^1]: A filmstrip is a series of individual frames containing images or text arranged in sequence on a strip of transparent or opaque material. In the context of today's technology-savvy teenagers, a filmstrip might be described as follows: Imagine a visual story told through a series of rectangular images, like the frames on Instagram stories, but in a linear format. Each frame depicts a scene or moment from the story, accompanied by text or captions to convey dialogue, narration, or additional context. The images are vibrant and dynamic, resembling the high-definition visuals found in movies and TV shows, but condensed into smaller, easily digestible segments. Think of it as a mini-movie that you can scroll through with your fingertips.

We had these hardware but there wasn't much content - software.\
In those days, content or multi-media needed to be physical or in-person.

Main source of inspiration was the Los Angeles Temple Visitor Center.

Then one day, we got a newly produced film strip and an audio cassette that accompanied it.\
We would visit a family, load the film strip into the projector and the audio cassette into the player.

Cue the audio cassette and start the filmstrip. 

Each frame would hold a message or a moment in time.   
And the narration or a portion of a song was provided by the audio cassette.   
The audio beep was the cue to turn to the next frame.

Inevitably, we would all be crying by the time the refrain was heard

> I'll build you a rainbow, way up high above.\
> Send down a sunbeam, plumb full of love.\
> Sprinkle down raindrops, teardrops of joy.\
> I'll be happy as spring-time, watchin' over my boy.

Remembering our own moms\
Or recalling ones we haven't seen in a while.

Big Jamie learned that Families are Forever from his mom.\
And his mom promised to build a rainbow to remind Jamie.

Likewise our Heavenly Father reminds us of the promises made and kept.

> "And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh..." - Genesis 9 (KJV)

Grateful for the reminders and lessons from years gone by.\
And those constant, nature provided instances.

Also reminders that are in writings and in songs.\
Technology that enables and invites that remembrance

That by recalling and remembering them and their works, that we may be protected and guided.

>...that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee^[Exodus 20:12]

Remembering and thanking those that have been with us and taught us.

Thank you mom.
어머니 감사합니다.
