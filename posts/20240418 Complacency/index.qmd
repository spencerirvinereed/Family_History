Wedding season

Like most weddings, was planning a Saturday sessions in a nearby temple.

Upon checking the wedding was to be held on Friday at a temple 30 minutes away.

On the day of the event, left home with 15 minutes of contingency time.
When I missed the exit the spare time was spent on the 8 mile round trip to return to the original exit.

Hurriedly ran up 3 stories of steps to make it the session.
It was a good thing these events are delayed a few minutes.

Living in an area with abundant temples and ease of getting there has conditioned me to time the arrival.

The same distance, if walked, would take 8 hours, instead of 27 minutes by car.

The luxury has dulled our sensing of planning and sense of urgency.
