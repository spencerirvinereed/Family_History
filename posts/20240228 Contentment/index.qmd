Dad was a hard worker.

In addition he was content.

There wasn't anything of this world that would sway or influence him.  

He had enough and was content

I believe experiencing the war first hand changed his outlook.

For everything that he experienced or had obtained was a bonus.

He dedicated balance of his life, 7 decades in the service of his family.

During those years, I have never seen or heard him complain or murmur.

Our Sunday School is taught by a well known Economics Professor at BYU.  

Even Professor K. declined to cover the Isaiah section of the 2nd Nephi.

Instead he covered the 2nd Chapter

As he discussed the 24th verse he stated.

>Joy is infused with Godliness

In addition, he drew this parallel,  

$$ Peace = Contentment = Joy $$

Thanks dad, for demonstrating that we are that we may be content.

Content with our lot and the circumstance.

For providing with necessary things of this world and protecting us from the evil influences.

And your courage during difficult times.

Miss you.
