As a foreigner learning English there are a number of hurdles.
Irregular verbs, irregular pronunciations, and irregular spellings.

Then there are similar terms with dissimilar meanings

- principal vs principle
- affect vs effect
- discrete vs discreet

Compliment and Complement

- Compliment: An expression of praise or admiration.
- Complement: Something that completes or goes well with something else.

Then is love complimentary or complementary

The easy answer is both.

However, I belived it starts as complimentary and grows into complementary


1 Corinthians 13


  
Here is 1 Corinthians 13 in the King James Version (KJV):

"1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. 2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, 5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; 6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; 7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.

8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. 9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. 10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. 11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.

13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity."

my mom and dad were different.
they may not have married had there been no war.

But marry they did and stay married for 62.

There marriage was far from perfect but they made it work.
Their views on things were differnt.

However their religion, views on life, and children made things possible

Their marriage was aided by relatives.
No choice of separation.

Their marriage is a demonstration of complementary forces and in the end we can give complimentary comments 

2 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
