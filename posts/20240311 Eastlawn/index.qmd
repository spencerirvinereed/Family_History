The Center Street in one town turns into 4800 North in another.
Then it becomes the Foothill Drive.

A left turn takes one, a couple hundred feet up to a bluff on the east side of the town.

From the knoll, one can see the river bottom area as well as the mountains and the lake that runs along the full length of the valley.

Perhaps the mountain behind it was the source for this mesa.  It may have tumbled down one day.  It is also possible that it was formed by the sediment from the old Bonneville Lake.

This is also a gathering and a resting place for many.
There is section that Korean Americans are buried.

Often, on New Years and memorable dates, we run into old acquaintances.

On the New Year's day, we met Steve K.
We hadn't seen him over 20 years. 
He was visiting his mom's grave, she had passed away in 2021.

It was great to catch up.

Then this Saturday, we met Steve's aunt.
Her mother passed away on March 9th, some 30 years ago.

When I was a student, I would visit her in Payson.
Remember they had an orchard

After marriage, we used to pick apples and asparagus there.
Now the orchard is no more and houses fill the area surrounding the Payson Temple.

Many of the Korean Saints settled in the Utah Valley area because of the gospel.

They served, testified and lived their faith.
My parents, Sister K's parents and the parent of Steve are interred here.

Grateful that we were able to catch up at the place of the resting place.  

Far removed from their birthplace yet close to their loved ones and ever closer to heaven.

May those mountains protect and sustain this sanctuary.
