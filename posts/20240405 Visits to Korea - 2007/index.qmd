Visited Korea a number of times but I did not get to meet mother's extended family.

One time in during summer of 2007.

Mom met one of her relatives.

The relative gave us 2 books containing records of mom's family

I couldn't recognize any of its writings.

Didn't fully appreciate its content and the work of gathering and preserving.
