Visited Korea a number of times.  
But I did not meet mother's extended family.

During summer of 2007, Mom met one of her relatives.

That relative gave us 2 books containing records of mom's family

I couldn't recognize any of its writings.  
Moreover I didn't understand the layout of that type of book.

I appreciated the work of gathering and preserving such records.

But the contents of the book was still inaccessible.

Over the years, I have had an interest in learning about the history, people and the language of China.

About 30 years ago, our company opened an operation in Suzhou (苏州市)^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzhou?oldformat=true]. 
One of the equipment to run its factory was sourced from Utah, where I was working.
I was chosen along with several other engineers to support that transfer.

My first trip to a country, other than Korea and US.
The experience was more than I had read about and heard from people that have traveled there.
More than I could have imagined 

Indeed, classical saying is

> 上有天堂, 下有苏杭

Above heaven, below Suzhou and Hangzhou.

Decided to pursue studying the language.
The course at SLCC (Salt Lake Community College) was taught by a gentleman from 桂林市^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilin]

Made some progress but gave up learning at an regularly scheduled intervals.

Met other individuals that encouraged me.
Including Pat Geraghty who quoted a study,

>People that learn a new language before the age of 14 can pick up any language, if they choose that route

Recently, had a dinner with a neighbor.
We had known them since school days as newly wed families.
We were welcoming their son who was recently married.
The husband and wife both worked at `Family Search`

Showed these 2 books to them.

They immediately gave a historical and practical overview and lesson on how to access these records.

## Renewed Effort

Opened its pages again.

Came across this record. Book 2 page 319, row 2
