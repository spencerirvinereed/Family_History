One was builder, a business man.
The other was a Rolling Stone, a wanderer.

They were both my grandfathers, who passed away nearly 20 years before I was born.

What I know about them I gathered from their children.

One grandfather had 4 surviving sons one daughter^[2 died in infancy and one was lost during the war] and the other 4 surviving daughters and a son^[2 died in infancy, and one was separated due to bombing of bridges]

Moreover, by observing traits of these uncles and aunts, I can imagine what type persons they were.

I believe one had stable home and was raised by a loving parent. taught about ways to build a family and to make a living in a steady and sure manner.
Take care of himself then others.
Progressive thinking based on work ethics and Christian beliefs

The other had a part time parent.
Not taught about work ethic or Christian beliefs.
Rely on yourself.
Backward thinking based on local, folk beliefs.

One drank alcohol and took part in gambling.
The other drank a little but refrained from indulging it them.

Both passed away in their mid-40s.

One became target of re-distribution of wealth, for he had acquired some property and businesses.

The other took part in re-distributing wealth of others.

One continued the tradition of education that thereby the next generation can start at a slightly higher level than prior generations

The other prolonged the lack of education that meant hard labor for the next generation

However, their story is still being written.
How we represent them, bearing their names.
We can honor their names and their memories

Perhaps take away some of their burdens that they had to carry in this life.

I believe future generations will be unified by religion, faith in Jesus Christ.
One that unites, heals, and cleanses all generations.

My mother saw one of my grandfather through a dream.

He was dressed in a white robe and had white hair and beard.
He was studying a set of books, even though, people around him were ridiculing him.

When my mother approach him, he gave a set of books.
They had the appearance of family records.

I will meet both of my grandfathers and we will talk about their lives.
How we are part of an earthly family
Also as spiritual beings that are making progress in this life and beyond.
