In set theory, when an element is not a member of any sets under consideration, it is said to be an element of the "empty set," also known as the "null set" or "void set." The empty set is denoted by the symbol âˆ… or { } (braces with nothing inside). It is a set with no elements. Therefore, any element outside of the sets being discussed would be considered an element of the empty set.
