My brother in laws mother is from Nagasaki (長崎).

We thought there were records of her family in Japan.

Recently, my sister found these records.

Wasn't expecting this immediate blessing.

Will get busy, hoping others can help me navigate and translate this.

Good websites on how to read Japanese family records?
