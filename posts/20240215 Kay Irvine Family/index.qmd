My brother in laws mother is from Nagasaki (長崎).

We thought there were records of her family in Japan.

Recently, my sister found these records.

![Record 1](ki.png)

![Record 2](ki1.png)

![Record 3](ki2.png)

![Record 4](ki3.png)

Wasn't expecting this immediate blessing.

Will get busy, hoping others can help me navigate and translate this.

Good websites on how to read Japanese family records?

Here's a link to understanding Korean records [link](https://www.familysearch.org/ko/help/helpcenter/lessons/%EC%A1%B1%EB%B3%B4-%EC%9D%BD%EA%B8%B0)

## Immediate Help

Translated by Meg　さん

This family tree was created by Kay Arakiさん herself.

(Her name is circled, lower right, second from right).

A wonderful layout with both common year as well as various Japanese period designations. Showa Period (昭和時代) and Taisho Era (大正時代)

It is quite amazing that she created this and that we were able to locate it.

Also have the technology and the language skills nearby to translate this

Also a reminder that midst all of the technology, a sheet of paper with a right arrangement of names and dates can capture precious information

Arakiさん, ありがとうございました!

(Thank you Spencer and Meg for your help)
