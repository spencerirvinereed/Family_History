Recently listened to an on-line meeting. A visiting authority, Young Men General Presidency member was speaking in Korea.

A young man was assigned to interpret for him.

He handled the assignment with skill and understanding beyond his years.

The speaker commented on the singing with "Wow!" And asked the young man to translate it into Korean. The interpreter said "와우으으" (the Korean prounciation of Wow)

Obviously young man was aware and comfortable in both languages and culture.

At times he guided the translation to better suit the audience of young Korean members.

Observing the cardinal rule of interpretation.

> Understanding by the audience over the exactness or technical excellence.

The latest ChatGPT would have made technically sound translation.

I am confident that the audience on that Sunday evening spiritually benefited from the talents of the interpreter.

A part of the 4-year assignment to Korea was to translate for visiting headquarter executives.

I could understand English fairly well, having lived in US for 25 years.

I chose words that I knew and formed expressions that captured the essence of the visitor's message.

Numbers in Korea are measured in units of 10,000 or 만(萬)

When US based spoke in terms of thousands of dollars, had to make some quick calculations along with remembering prevailing currency exchange rate (1 USD = 1,400 KRW, the rate at that time)

Another mental hurdle was remembering several units for measuring an area.

Metric unit is square meters, meter$^{2}$.

However, Koreans use the unit of 평(坪, pyong) when measuring a building or apartment spaces.

평 is about 3.3 square meters. Or a 6 ft by 6 ft space, or 36 square feet.

Depending on who was descrbing the space, one had to have those conversion factors memorized.

After a while, however, I no longer relied on the conversion factors.

As most missionaries and expats have experienced, I became familiar with the local currency and value of things.

I would walk into an apartment and think in terms of 평 Recognizing that most popular apartment sizes were in the 30+평 (\~1200 feet$^{2}$, 115 meter$^{2}$) neighborhood.

Life got easier as adjusted to Korean ways of measuring, reckoning and living.

In this life, we make sense of things by assigning values and by learning the interpretation of the locals.

Moreover, there are numerous guides and approach on how to adjust to a new place, written by visitors and locals alike.

However, we all share the memories and reminders of the same place of origin.

The home that we came from and the same eternal home that we all will return to someday.

How or whether we incorporate elements from that home in this life is matter of choice and tradition.

Look forward to a time when no interpretation is necessary, due to advancements in technology and by embracing traditions that bring us together.

For we all have felt that order and harmony -- at times in our lives.

Traditions of our fathers and mothers will be updated and some jettisoned.

> ...till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;

-   Ephesians 4:13

> For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.

-   Habakkuk 2:14
