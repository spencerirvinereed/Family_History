Turn of the century was a time of confluence in Korea.

The old music, once available in records or vinyls were repackaged and available in digital audio format (Compact Disks).

A boxed set of popular music was available in all places.
For a price of 2 movie tickets one could own nearly 50 years of music history in 6 CDs. 

113 songs in all.

Recently discovered these 2 boxed set and its packaging
One box, containing Memories 추억, had this message imprinted.

> We... sometimes think of our parents. 
> Sometimes, our parents... take a break from thinking of us.

My parents and I often listened to these songs together. 
My parents knew songs from the first 2 CDs by heart.
For they had experienced the stories mentioned in these songs

The songs my parents listened in their 20s and 30s.

As I listened with them, I could imagine their struggles and understood why these songs were meaningful.

A combination of words and music that covered what should have been their life's high moments that became its most disappointing and discouraging moments.

Yet somehow, these songs had a hint of hopeful messages, my parents' life overcame those challenges and established a family.

Now my parents are no longer with us. 
They have finished their mission in this life.

Wonder how often they take break from thinking of us and watching over us.

Each time I think of them, my appreciation and love for them deepens.

A spring storm came, the setting sun cast its light towards the mountains and clouds.  

The confluence of light and clouds, refractions and reflections created rainbows against the Cascade mountain.

That rainbow reminded me our lives is a miracle.
The relationships are eternal.
There are eternal and natural truths

A fleeting, physical reminder from our parents.
A collective message of love and appreciation from the children.

Thank you for teaching and living your lives so that we can traverse this life with a sure knowledge. 

> And this is life eternal,

>that they might know thee the only true God,

>and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent
