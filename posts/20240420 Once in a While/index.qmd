Turn of the century was a time of confluence in Korea.

The old music, once available in records or vinyls were repackaged and available in digital audio format (Compact Disks).

A boxed set of popular music was available in all places.
For a price of 2 movie tickets one could own nearly 50 years of music history in 6 CDs. 

113 songs in all.

Recently discovered these 2 boxed set and its packaging
One box, containing Memories 추억, had this message imprinted.

> We... sometimes think of our parents. 
> Sometimes, our parents... take a break from thinking of us.

My parents and I often listened to these songs together. 
My parents knew songs from the first 2 CDs by heart.
For they had experienced the stories mentioned in these songs

The songs my parents listened in their 20s and 30s.

As I listened with them, I could imagine their struggles and understood why these songs were meaningful.

A combination of words and music that covered what should have been their life's high moments that became its most disappointing and discouraging moments.

Yet somehow, these songs had a hint of hopeful messages, my parents' life overcame those challenges and established a family.

Now my parents are no longer with us. 
They have finished their mission in this life.

Wonder how often they take break from thinking of us and watching over us.

Each time I think of them, my appreciation and love for them deepens.

A spring storm came, the setting sun cast its light towards the mountains and clouds.  

The confluence of light and clouds, refractions and reflections created rainbows against the Cascade mountain.

That rainbow reminded me our lives is a miracle.
The relationships are eternal.
There are eternal and natural truths

A fleeting, physical reminder from our parents.
A collective message of love and appreciation from the children.

Thank you for teaching and living your lives so that we can traverse this life with a sure knowledge. 

> And this is life eternal,

>that they might know thee the only true God,

## Chat GPT Explains how rainbow works

A rainbow is a natural occurrence that happens when sunlight is refracted, or bent, and then reflected inside raindrops. This creates a spectrum of colors in the sky. Here's how it works:

1. **Sunlight:** It all begins with sunlight. Sunlight may look white, but it's actually composed of various colors, from red to violet.

2. **Refraction:** When sunlight encounters raindrops suspended in the air, the light is bent as it enters the droplet. This happens because light travels at different speeds through air and water. As sunlight moves from air into the denser water inside the droplet, it slows down and bends.

3. **Reflection:** Once inside the raindrop, the light reflects off the inside surface. It then reflects off the back surface and exits the droplet.

4. **Dispersion:** As the light exits the raindrop, it's spread out into its component colors. This happens because different colors of light bend by different amounts inside the droplet, causing them to separate into a spectrum.

5. **Multiple Reflections:** Some of the dispersed light travels to the observer's eyes, forming the appearance of a rainbow. The light undergoes multiple reflections inside the raindrop before exiting, causing the different colors to spread out in an arc.

6. **Angular Dependence:** The angle at which the observer sees the rainbow depends on the angle of sunlight entering the raindrops and how the light exits them. This is why rainbows are typically seen when the sun is low and the observer is facing away from it.

In summary, a rainbow is a beautiful result of sunlight interacting with raindrops and the principles of optics.
